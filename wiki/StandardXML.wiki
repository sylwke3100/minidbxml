<code>
{{{ 
<header>
 <Program>MiniDBXML</Program> 
 <Version>0.0.5 - Alpha </Version> - 
 <Time_Date>Sun Nov 21 16:27:17 2010
 </Time_Date>
</header>

}}} 
</code>

===3.Tag===
Part of the tag is to write the column names stored so that the program can easily identify.<br> Each entry in the column is to begin and end: <tg> tag on it (everything has to be in one line and another entry in the next release).<br> For example:
<code>
{{{
<tag>
<tg>Name</tg>
<tg>Surname</tg>
</tag>
}}}
